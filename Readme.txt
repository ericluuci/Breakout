This is the classic atari game BREAKOUT.

The game will require pygame to install and is written in python 2.7

You control a platform at the bottom of the window and try to not let the ball touch the ground. The ball bounces off the top and side of the window as well as the player-controlled platform and the multi-colored blocks near the top of the window. When the ball touches one of the colored blocks, the block disappears. The game ends when all the colored blocks are gone.

Play using mouse.
